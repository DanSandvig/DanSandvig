- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanSandvig
- 👀 I’m interested in studying programming and software development from all angles and someday hope to be able to just say "yes" when someone asks me if I know something.
- 🌱 I’ve just finished working through a government funded Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Development with QA Ltd
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects suitable for a beginner in Java, Python and Web Development, or someone with hobbyist-level experience in Unity and C#.
- 📫 [E-mail me](mailto:dspublicaddress@protonmail.com)
